# ReallySmartBrain

ReallySmartBrain is a mini project I enjoyed working on as part of [@aneagoie's The Complete Python Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course.

In this project, I utilized the `imageai` library and downloaded various pre-trained models, such as MobileNetV2, to predict the content of given images.

## Features
- Importing the `imageai` library
- Utilizing pre-trained models for image prediction
- Predicting the content of images using models like MobileNetV2

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ReallySmartBrain.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained models and place them in the appropriate directory (refer to the project documentation for details).

4. Run the prediction script:
   ```bash
   python predict.py 
   ```
   You can try different images and models. For different models, you can refer to the options available at ImageAI's Model Zoo. Make sure to download the models and place them in the appropriate directory.
