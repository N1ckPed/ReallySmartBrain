# ReallySmartBrain

ReallySmartBrain is a mini project I enjoyed working on as part of [@aneagoie's The Complete Python Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course.

In this project, I utilized the `imageai` library and downloaded various pre-trained models, such as MobileNetV2, to predict the content of given images.

## Features
- Importing the `imageai` library
- Utilizing pre-trained models for image prediction
- Predicting the content of images using models like MobileNetV2
