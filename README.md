# ReallySmartBrain

ReallySmartBrain is a mini project I enjoyed working on as part of [@aneagoie's The Complete Python Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course.

In this project, I utilized the `imageai` library and downloaded various pre-trained models, such as MobileNetV2, to predict the content of given images.

## Features
- Importing the `imageai` library
- Utilizing pre-trained models for image prediction
- Predicting the content of images using models like MobileNetV2

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ReallySmartBrain.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained models and place them in the appropriate directory (refer to the project documentation for details).

4. Run the prediction script:
   ```bash
   python predict.py #change the "house.jpg" with your image.
   ```
